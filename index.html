        <h1>The Grimoire</h1>
        <p>The Grimoire is a DND campaign run by bastion_falls for a group of five players. It is set in a completely homebrewed world and played with the fifth edition rules. 
            Originally intending to be a oneshot, the group got along so well that they decided to continue playing in this world as a full-on campaign. </p>
        <p>The first session took place on the small island of Trassen, a place overrun by monsters. Its only city was protected from the rest of the island by a magical barrier created by a grimoire. 
            Five adventurers were called to action when the was grimoire stolen from its place. Coming from all walks of life and ending up on this island for many different reasons, the group of 
            adventurers formed an unlikely team to take down the evil plaguing the island only to discover a mysterious curse at the center of it all.</p>
        <p>The player characters of The Grimoire include:</p> 
        <p>Aelene, a wood elf druid whose first appearance was as an albatross that fell out of the sky. She has a connection to birds and wants to become one. Generally reserved but hilariously blunt. </p>
        <p>Chi Yan, an elf wizard who hates the ocean for some reason. Best known for adding vocabulary into his journal because Common is his second language and being overly formal. </p>
        <p>Garath Skyprotector Veomaga, a goliath fighter with a mysterious past. All we know is that he left his old life behind. He is probably the only person who has some semblance of common sense in this group.</p>
        <p>Theodore Rivers, a human ranger and a cowboy. The most impulsive of the group, he eats random weeds growing from the ground and can be described as a little trigger happy.</p>
        <p>Shrejuri Cipunatime, a half orc cleric and the most money obsessed individual you will ever meet. He's quite immature, greedy, and flirts with anything that moves. </p>
